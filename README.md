# PhysicistsIntroduction2Jupyter
This Repository is created to supply Physics students with introductory Jupyter Notebooks to learn coding in Python for physics projects. This repository only contains introductional material and some general tools that are not specific to some domain of physics. Other repositories are set-up for domain-specific purposes.
